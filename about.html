          <p>Stuart, a Calgary, Alberta native, retired from corporate tech life at the age of forty to spend more time with his family in S. California (including a tour of duty as “Mr. Mom”) and explore other pursuits.  He became a part-time investor and aspiring triathlete, having overcome multiple traumatic accidents to make the podium at national competitions.  Racing in honor of loved ones impacted by cancer and other adversities, Stuart has competed at amateur world championships for both Team USA and Canada.  Little did he know that this all would lead to the weird and wonderful encounters documented in his book and subsequent HumZillion videos/other content.  He hopes his experiences can be a source of inspiration for others facing adversity and seeking more purpose in life.  He has an MBA degree from Harvard Business School and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Calgary.</p>
